MODULE
- each application has at least one module - the root module. That is the starting point of the application
- modules are an effective way to organize components by a closely related set of capabilities (e.g. per feature)
- it is a good practive to have a folder per module, containing the module's components
- modules in NestJS are SINGLETONS, therefore a module can be imported by multiple other modules

Defining a module
- A module is defined by annotating a class with the @Module decorator
- The decorator provides metadata that Nest uses to organize the application structure

@Module decorator properties
providers - Array of providers to be available within the module via dependency injection
controllers - Array of controllers to be instantiated within the module
exports - Array of providers to export to other modules
imports - List of modules required by this module

CONTROLLER
- is a class controlling the entry flow
- responsible for handling incoming requests and returning responses to the client
- bound to a specific path (for example, "/tasks" for the task resource)
- contains handlers, which handle endpoints and request methods (GET, POST, DELETE etc)
- can take advantage of dependency injection to consume providers within the same module

Defining a controller
- Conrollers are defined by decorating a class with the @Controller decorator
- The decorator accepts a string, which is the path to be handled by the controller

Defining a handler in controller
- Handlers are simply method within the controller class, decorated with decorators such as @Get, @Post, @Delete etcetera

PROVIDERS
- can be injected into constructors if decorated as an @Injectable, via dependency injection
- can be a plain value, a class, sync/async factory etc
- providers must be provided tto a module for them to be usable
- can be exported from a module - and then be available to other modules that import it

SERVICES
- defined as providers, NOT ALL PROVIDERS ARE SERVICES
- common concept within software development and are not exclusive NestJS, JavaScrip or back-end development
- singleton when wrapped with @Injectable() and provided to a module. That means, the same instance will be shared across the application as a single source of truth
- the main source of business logic. For example, a service will be called from a controller to validate data, create an item in the database and return a response

DEPENDENCY INJECTION IN NestJS
- any component within the NestJS ecosystem can inject a provider that is decorated with the @Injectable
- we define the dependencies in the constructor of the class. NestJS will take care of the injection for us, and it will then be available as a class property


DATA TRANSFER OBJECT (DTO)
- a data transfer object is an objec that carries data between processes
- common concept in softwere development that is not specific to NestJS
- result is more bulletproof code, as it can be used as a TypeScript type
- do not have any behaviour except for storage, retrieval, serialization and deserialization of its own data
- result in icreased performace (although negligible in small applications)
- can be useful for data validation
- a DTO is NOT a model definition. Its defines the shape of data for a specific case, for example - creating a task

CLASSES VS INTERFACES FOR DTOs
- Data Transfer Objects can be defined as classes or interfaces
- the recommended approach is to use CLASSES, also clearly documented in the NestJS documentation
- the reason is that interfaces are a part of TypeScript and therefore are not preserved post-compilation
- classes allow us to do more, and since they are a part of JavaScript, the will be preserved post-compilation
- NestJS cannot refer to interfaces in run-time, but can refer to classes

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT DTO
- Data Transfer OBject are NOT mandatory
- You can still develop applications without using DTOs
- however, the value they add makes it worthwhile to use them when applicable
- applying the DTO pattern as soon as possible will make it easy for You to maintain and refactor Your code

PIPES
- pipes operate on he arguments to be processed by the route handler, just before the handler is called
- pipes can perform data transformation or data validation
- pipes can return data - either original or modified -which will be passed on the route handler
- pipes can throw exceptions. Exceptions thrown will be handled by NestJS and parsed into an error response
- pipe can be asynchronous
- pipes can be consumed in different ways

- pipes are classes annotated with the @Injectable() decorator
- pipes must implement the PipeTransform generic interface. Therefore, every pipe must have a transform() method. This method will be called by NestJS to process the arguments.
- the transform() method accepts two parameter:
 - value, the value of processed argument
 - metadata - optional, an object containing metadata about the argument

- whatever is returned from the transform() method will be passed on the route handler. Exceptions will be send back to the client

Object Relational Mapping (ORM)
- Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique tha lets you query and manipulate data from a database, using an object-oriented paradigm
- there are many ORM libraries thet allow developers to communicate to the database using their preferred programming language - rather than sending plain queries directly

plusy ORM'a
- writing the data model in one place -easier to maitain. Less repetition.
- lots of things done automatically - database handling, data types, relations etcetera
- no need to write SQL syntax (easy to learn, hard to master). Using your natural way of coding
- Database abstraction - you can change the database type whenever you wish
- leverages OOP, therefore things like inheritance are easy to achieve

minusy ORM'a
- you have to learn it, and ORM libraries are not always simple
- performance is alright, but it's easy to neglect
- makes it easy to forget (or never learn) what's happening behind the scenes, which can lead to a variety of maintainability issues
